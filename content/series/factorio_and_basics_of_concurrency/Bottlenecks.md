> In many ways. In Factorio, your factory can have concurrency, parallelism, race conditions, bottlenecks, deadlocks, resource starvation, etc, etc.
> Looking for those types of problems and solving them is a very fun feedback loop.
> You can spend a few hours just walking around a large factory, making small incremental improvements as you go, and your entire factory will be visibly better off.
> The only thing preventing you from doing this to your application is the lack of visibility into the problems.
> There's a bottleneck in your code right now, but can you find it? They're almost never detectable by simple inspection of the source code, so it takes specialized tools.
> I would say then that building a large factory is like an optimal form of programming where nothing is opaque or hidden from you.
