I love bein alone    
But I hate being lonely   
I love making people smile and laugh  
But I hate being the centre of attention   
I love night time  
But I hate the darkness    
I love to dream big  
But I hate the thought of failure  
I love watching the sunrise   
But I hate waking up  
I love life.  
But I hate that it scares the sh*t out of me.  
I want to improve.   
But I hate that it gets too difficult at times.  
I want to die sometimes.  
But I am scared of what it will do to everyone around me.    
I want to be strong.  
But I hate the responsibility of tough situations.  
I want to say I have it figured out.  
But the reality is that I'm the last person to know a single thing about my own self.  
I love people unconditionally  
But I fear the Bereavement.  
I want to open up to people.  
But I think they might find the opened up self disgusting and repulsive.

Despite things seeming obvious, I find myself doubting. 

The dichotomy of life is that I feel both ways and despite knowing what to do, the mind.
