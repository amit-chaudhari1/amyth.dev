title: Discovering the way I work
draft: true

I've realised one thing about my self these past days. 
Thanks to a friend who just straight up told me what it was and how it was i was working. 

This made me ponder for the first time in my career, to not think about the way I did things, but rather find a way that things worked for me. 

So how do I discover how I like to work?

# I rely on spontaneous motivations

# I rely on systems that help me capture these the moment they come.
# I rely on structure but i keep breaking that structure every few weeks cause i think it can be better.
# I am motivated by the stupidest of things.
# I want to improve.
